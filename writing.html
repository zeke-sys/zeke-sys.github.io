        <h2>What audit taught me about code reviews</h2>
        <p>
          Years in IT audit shaped how I approach reviews: evidence over assumptions, clear traceability, and a focus on real risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          In code, that translates to small pull requests, explicit reasoning in descriptions, and tests that prove the behavior we care about.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="home-featured-card">
        <h2>Building a trie autocomplete from scratch</h2>
        <p>
          Implementing a trie pushed me to think carefully about memory layout, traversal patterns, and how user behavior influences data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser demo on this site mirrors the C++ implementation and makes those ideas visible as you type.
        </p>

      <article class="home-featured-card">
        <h2>Bringing security thinking into early designs</h2>
        <p>
          Security is most effective when it's part of the first draft, not a bolt-on. I like to ask, "What can go wrong here?" before writing code.
        </p>
        <p>
          That mindset helps catch issues in logging, error handling, and data flows long before they reach production.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="home-featured-card">
        <h2>Turning audit findings into tests</h2>
        <p>
          In audit, every finding comes with a control objective and evidence. I like to translate that into concrete unit and integration tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          That way, once a weakness is fixed, it stays fixed — and future changes have to prove they don’t reintroduce the same risk.
        </p>

      <article class="home-featured-card">
        <h2>Small automations that actually ship</h2>
        <p>
          The most useful scripts I’ve written weren’t complex — they automated boring checks, file moves, or report formatting my team did every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim for tools that are easy to run, easy to explain, and safe to hand off so they survive long after the first use case.
